# Development environment

In this project you will find all the different programs with resp. configurations, that I use
when programming.

## tmux
This is a usefull program to split the terminal and have multiple processes running. The configuration
can be found in the tmux.conf file. Make sure you put this in your ~ folder but with the name 
.tmux.conf
Afterwards you just need to install the program using
```bash
sudo apt-get install tmux
```
